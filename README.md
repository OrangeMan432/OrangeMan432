#I'm failing high school because i have
no self control and spend my time here instead of doing homework 
### mainly i am working on a hacked client for a web port of minecraft  
No clue what version its gonna be on for the release. probably r1.8.8 or b1.7.3

I enjoy anarchy Minecraft, mainly 5b5t. I may make a 1.12.2 client soon since all the current ones are outdated and 5b5t is buggy on 1.20. (possibly canceled, grim cpvp is more enjoyable for me)
